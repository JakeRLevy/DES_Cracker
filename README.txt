Included in this folder is the completed DES assignment for our Network Security class in the Rowan U MS Program, taught by 
Dr. Hnatyshin.  FINAL_DES_REPORT.pdf contains the broken key that we found using a brute force attack a detailed description of DES
implementation used for our program.  You can find the main application file and the DES library in the src folder.

The project was coded in C.
